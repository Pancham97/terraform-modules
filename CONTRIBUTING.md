## Consider raising an issue first if your proposed PR:

* introduces breaking changes

## Things to consider

* Follow best pacticies for Terraform modules like
    - Folder Structure ( distribute code in `variables.tf`, `main.tf` and `outputs.tf`)
    - Do not hardcode values and keep them configurable
    - Mention minimum required provider version
    - Provide default values when possible
    - Update List in base [README](README.md) when adding or removing a module
